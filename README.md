# sbvr-vscode

This is an extension for a very simple semantic tokens provider for a SBVR standard. This semantic tokens provider always returns all the tokens in a file.

The SBVR standard defines the vocabulary and rules for documenting the semantics of business vocabularies, business facts, and business rules; as well as an XMI schema for the interchange of business vocabularies and business rules among organizations and between software tools.
